                        <p class="lede">My name is Jack King. For the past four years I've been studying computer science and neuroscience at MIT. Now, I'm a master’s student doing computational neuroscience.</p>
                        <p>I study the neural circuits and representational geometry that make intelligence possible—how patterns of activity in a network, whether neural or artificial, become the architecture of thought. In <a href="https://www.evlab.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Ev Fedorenko’s Language Lab</a>, I investigated how predictive structure emerges in both human brain activity and large language models, shedding light on the computations that support language processing. Now, in <a href="https://fietelab.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Ila Fiete’s lab</a>, I’m building biologically plausible neural network models of learning, memory, and top-down cognition.</p>
                        <p>When I’m not in the lab, I’m probably in the ocean surfing, chasing the feeling of being tuned to a complex, dynamic system. I also spend a lot of time <a href="/reading.html">reading</a> and <a href="/writing.html">writing</a>, drawn to ideas and stories that reveal hidden structure in the world. Whether in science or in art, my work is guided by the same pursuit: to uncover how minds organize experience into understanding.</p>

In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map was Useless, …”</blockquote>
